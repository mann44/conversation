If possible, avoid giving chronological work history\nStay away from bad mouthing your last employer and focus on the positive\nTry and stay away from anything that draws on the politics, culture or financial health of your previous employer. No matter how true it might be, comments like these will be construed as too negative. Also, you don’t want to focus on a function that might be your responsibility in the next role. So think of something you disliked in your last job, but that you know for sure won’t be part of this new role.\n \nBased on your personality analysis, potential employers may see you as:\n \nOpenness  85%\nEmotional range 67%\nConscientiousness 41%\nIntroversion/Extraversion 22%\nAgreeableness 18%\nCuriosity 92%\nStructure 89%\nChallenge 56%\nIdeal 56%\nLiberty 35%\nStimulation 72%\nAchievement 49%\nHelping others 47%\nTaking pleasure in life 16%\n \nThe Tone of your communications indicates:\n \nAnalytical, Joyful, Agreeable, Open and slightly tentative.\n \nGood luck with your interview!
