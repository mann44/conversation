The Career Mentor Bot is designed to provide career counseling service typically that would be provided by a human career coach. For this competition, we have prototyped an Interview Coach bot which provided Question-Answer interview practice for HR and Behavioral type interviews. A second bot called the Feedback Coach bot takes the responses provided by the Interview Coach bot and provided feedback to the user by applying personality analyzer and tone analyzer and also analysis of the response content itself. Towards further development, we plan to develop it out into a complete Career Coaching experience and provide the crucial interview, job targeting and career coaching experience which otherwise needs time and fees with an actual human career coach. The system will be designed to be adaptive and context driven so as to provide a realistic user experience.
